Beta

This is a Python script for a mouse clicker that generates click timing based on Berlin noise, with movement trajectories following cubic Bézier curves and anthropomorphic functions.

Script Installation Method:
Manually install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/latest/python3.10/ download python, preferably version 3.10;
Click the "Base Instal.bat" file in the folder to install or uninstall two required Python libraries;
Double-click "Start Script.bat", or open the .py executable file with VS Code and trust it. After trusting, a triangle button will appear in the top-right corner. Click it to run the script.

Script Usage: 1. Move your mouse to the designated position in the game. 2. Press the "F8" key on your keyboard (usually located on the top row; if it doesn't work, you might be using a laptop—try pressing the "Fn" key in the bottom left corner simultaneously with "F8"). 3. Press the Esc key at the top left corner of the keyboard to stop the script.
