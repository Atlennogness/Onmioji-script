Beta Trial Version

This Python script creates a mouse clicker that generates click timing based on Berlin noise, with movement trajectories following cubic Bézier curves and anthropomorphic functions.

Usage: Click the BAT file in the folder to install or uninstall two required Python libraries. Python version 3.10 is recommended. Open the .py executable file with VS Code and trust it. After trusting, a triangular button will appear in the top-right corner. Click it to run the script.

Note: 1. Position the mouse cursor at the designated location within the game. 2. Press the "F8" key on your keyboard (typically located on the top row; if it doesn't work, you might be using a laptop—try pressing the "Fn" key on the bottom left of the keyboard simultaneously with "F8"). 3. Press the Esc key at the top left corner of the keyboard to stop the script.
